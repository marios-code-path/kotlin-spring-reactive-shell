# Build a Backend Shell App for Reactive Services with Spring Shell in Kotlin

What if I told you that the Spring Framework supportes creating [Shell](https://spring.io/projects/spring-shell) tools programatically? 

# Motivation

As back-end developers, we are so used to deploying a front-end to guage our efforts. Perhaps you use [postman](https://www.postman.com) to send requests to your REST services. Maybe you're an RSocket kind of person and are using the [rsocket-cli](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-cli) tool. You might even be a streaming person, and send messages directly into your stream ingress! In any case, there exists the necessity to 'walk' through our services from the edge, and outside of the purview of any test regiment.

We sometimes want to create a control panel that is not exposed through the web, but is something that can be simply run from the commandline.  This is the reason why shcell scripts typically exist. This is also why we have so many shells like (omzsh, prezto, etc..).  Indeed, shells are a vital if not necessary component of daily developer life.

Using Spring Shell to do this is a neat trick.


Because UPS doesn't deliver HTTP requests, use a Shell instead.
